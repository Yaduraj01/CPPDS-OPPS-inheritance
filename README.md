# CPPDS-OPPS-inheritance
Inheritance in OOP allows one class (the child) to inherit attributes and behaviors from another class (the parent). It promotes code reuse and establishes a hierarchical "is-a" relationship between classes, where the child class is a specialized version of the parent class.

Algorithm - CODE 1 

1. Define a base class called "vehicle."
2. In the "vehicle" class, you may have attributes and methods specific to all vehicles.
3. Create a derived class called "car" that inherits from the "vehicle" class. This inheritance is set as "private," making all public and protected members of the "vehicle" class private in the "car" class.
4. In the "car" class, you can have attributes and methods specific to cars.
5. In the "main" function, create an instance of the "car" class.
